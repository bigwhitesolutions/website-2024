## About

This event is one of my favourites, I sadly will be missing this one as I will be away, Dan and Matt the Hosts are both really welcoming and I would highly recommend attending the pub after the event for some really great conversation

**Dan Clarke** Automate stuff with .NET and Tasker
**James World** Improving your technical design
**Matt Gallagher** Why we love SAFE Stack
**Neil Docherty** TDD with bUnit
