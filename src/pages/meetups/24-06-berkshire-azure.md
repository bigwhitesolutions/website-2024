## Venue

Hosted at the Microsoft Offices in TVP the venue was amazing, easy access from the A329M and plenty of parking. The room the meetup was held in was great, plenty of space for everyone and while slightly late the Pizza's were very welcome!

## Atmosphere

There was over 50 people that turned up from hugely diverse backgrounds, I managed to to speak to Senior Developers, Team Leads, Product Managers, Data engineers and even some recruiters that seemed to have a genuine interest in the topics

## Speakers

- **Arshia Bhatnagar** Accelerating your development journey using github co-pilot

This was an excellent session for those new to github co-pilot to see some of the amazing things it can do.

 Arshia took us through an entire development cycle in 30 minutes, creating an app adding some new functionality to it and deploying it (almost) to azure.

 It was amazing to see how it can help you to write the basic code blocks you need but still requires the developer to understand and combine those in the right way

- **Dias Manjaly** Azure service bus

Dias is one of the organisers of this group and stepped up at the last minute after a speaker dropped out but that didn't stop this talk being engaging and full of useful information, even if the azure portal forced a UI change on him on the day!

The talk was focused around an individual who had paid his road tax but while the DVLA knew about this transaction the police did not. Dias then shows how service bus could help the government agencies achieve near real time updates using resilient message queues.

It was a very clever way to make the content accessible to the whole room while allowing him to delve into the details then he needed too.
