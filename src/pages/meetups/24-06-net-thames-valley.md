## About

I will be missing this one as I will be lying on a beach in Turkey... well until my 3 year old wants me to build the 14th sand cast of the day...

However as one of the host I have seen the slides decks and it is looking like an amazing set of talks

## Speakers

**Poornima Nayar** (Microsoft MVP & Software Engineer, Particular Software) - 'REST, gRPC, GraphQL or Asynchronous Messaging'

Be it any industry, applications need to talk to each other. So, developers often build bridges – Application Programming Interfaces (API) – to allow one system to communicate with another.

REST, gRPC, GraphQL and Asynchronous Messaging are all patterns of communication between distributed systems. What are the core concepts behind these patterns? Do you know what problems they try to address? What about the use cases? Join Poornima’s session to find out the answers to these questions!

**Aaron Green** (Consultant, iO Associates) - 'Confident Communication (and Why it Matters)'

Being autistic, confidence—especially in communication—hasn't always come naturally to Aaron. He often found himself searching for the mystical, elusive rules underlying communication, likability, rapport, and trust. Delving into books, consuming hours of video content, and experimenting through trial and error, Aaron has tried to uncover the principles of confident communication.

Confidence is the secret sauce that helps you build trust in others, and the ability to communicate confidently can unlock not only better quality interactions but also new career prospects, higher salaries, improved team buy-in, stronger work relationships, and, a better overall quality of life.

In his talk, Aaron takes you on a journey, through belief, body language, and a little bit of science, to offer a fresh perspective on communication. This talk is designed to inspire hope; and to show you that if you feel your communication could use some work, it's within your power to improve it and get the opportunities you deserve in your tech career.
