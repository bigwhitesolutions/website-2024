## About

One of the groups I like to attend that is a little outside the usual world of architecture and code. While you will find the odd developer there, you will be surrounded by people who live and breath agile, they have an amazing global audience that was grown over the last few years.

As a host for .Net Thames Valley it is always good to pick up new habits around better public speaking so this seems like a great event to attend
